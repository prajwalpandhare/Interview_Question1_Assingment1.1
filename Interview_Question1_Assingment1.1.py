# # # # # What are lists and tuples? What is the key difference between the two?

# # # # # Lists and Tuples are both sequence data types that can store a collection of objects in Python. 
# # # # # The objects stored in both sequences can have different data types. 
# # # # # Lists are represented with square brackets ['dolly', 5, 0.10], while tuples are represented with parantheses ('rahul', 8, 0.97).

# # # # # The key difference between the two is that while lists are mutable, tuples on the other hand are immutable objects.

# # # # # QUE2.
# # # # # What are the common built-in data types in Python?
# # # # # Python supports the below-mentioned built-in data types:

# # # # # Immutable data types:

# # # # # Number
# # # # # String
# # # # # Tuple
# # # # # Mutable data types:

# # # # # List
# # # # # Dictionary
# # # # # set

# # # # QUE3.
# # # # What does [::-1] do?
# # # # [::-1] ,this is an example of slice notation and helps to reverse the sequence with the help of indexing.

# # # # QUE4.
# # # # How to comment with multiple lines in Python?
# # # # To add a multiple lines comment in python, all the line should be prefixed by #.

# # # # QUE5.

# # # # What is a map function in Python?
# # # # The map() function in Python has two parameters, function and iterable. 
# # # # The map() function takes a function as an argument and then applies that function to all the elements of an iterable,
# # # # passed to it as another argument. It returns an object list of results.

# # # QUE.6

# # # Name four of the main data types in Python
# # # Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets are generally considered the main types of data.

# # # QUE.6

# # # What does mapping mean and what kind of data type is based on mapping?
# # # The term mapping refers to an object that maps keys to associated values. 
# # # The Python dictionary is the only type of mapping in the base typeset. Mappings do not maintain any left-to-right position order; 
# # # they support access to stored data by key, as well as type-specific method calls

# # # QUE7.

# # # Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python?
# # # These methods belong to the Python RegEx or ‘re’ module and are used to modify strings.

# # # split(): This method is used to split a given string into a list.
# # # sub(): This method is used to find a substring where a regex pattern matches, 
# # # and then it replaces the matched substring with a different string.
# # # subn(): This method is similar to the sub() method, but it returns the new string, along with the number of replacements.

# # # QUE8.

# # # What are the two types of functions in Python?
# # # There are two types of functions in Python: built-in functions and user-defined functions. 
# # # Built-in functions are functions that are already defined in the Python language, such as the print() function. 
# # # User-defined functions are functions that are created by the user, 
# # # and they can be created to do anything that the user wants them to do.

# # # QUE9.

# # # Do Python functions have return values? If yes, then how many can they have?
# # # Yes, Python functions can have return values. They can have a single return value, or they can have multiple return values.

# # # QUE10.

# # # What does the method object() do?
# # # The method returns a featureless object that is base for all classes. This method does not take any parameters.

# # # QUE11.

# # # Define self in Python.
# # # Self is an instance of a class or an object in Python. It is included as the first parameter. 
# # # It helps differentiate between the methods and attributes of a class with local variables

# # # QUE12.

# # # What is the Pass statement?
# # # A Pass statement in Python is used when we cannot decide what to do in our code, 
# # # but we must type something to make it syntactically correct.

# # # QUE13.

# # # Can we reverse a list in Python?
# # # Yes, we can reserve a list in Python using the reverse() method. The code is as follows:

# # # def reverse(s):
# # #  str = "" 
# # #  for i in s: 
# # #    str = i + str
# # #   return str


# # # QUE14.

# # # Why do we need a break?
# # # Break helps control the Python loop by breaking the current loop from execution and transferring the control to the next block


# # # QUE15.

# # # Do Python functions have return values? If yes, then how many can they have?
# # # Yes, Python functions can have return values. They can have a single return value, or they can have multiple return values.

# # # QUE16.

# # # What does the method object() do?
# # # The method returns a featureless object that is base for all classes. This method does not take any parameters.

# # # QUE17.

# # # How would you convert JSON to Python objects?
# # # The json library in Python can help you convert JSON data into Python objects. 
# # # The process is known as decoding. You can use the json.loads() function to decode JSON data. 
# # # This function takes a JSON string and returns a Python object.


# # # QUE18.

# # # What are the two types of functions in Python?
# # # There are two types of functions in Python: built-in functions and user-defined functions. 
# # # Built-in functions are functions that are already defined in the Python language, such as the print() function. 
# # # User-defined functions are functions that are created by the user, and they can be created to do anything that the user wants them to do.


# # # QUE19.

# # What is _init_?
# # _init_ is a contructor method in Python and is automatically called to allocate memory when a new object/instance is created. 
# # All classes have a _init_ method associated with them. 
# # It helps in distinguishing methods and attributes of a class from local variables.

# QUE20.

# What is lambda in Python? Why is it used?
# Lambda is an anonymous function in Python, that can accept any number of arguments, but can only have a single expression. 
# It is generally used in situations requiring an anonymous function for a short time period.
